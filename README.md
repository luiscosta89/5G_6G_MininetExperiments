# 5G and 6G experiments for Mininet Wi-Fi

This repository contains the scripts for the experiments in Mininet Wi-Fi for my PhD Thesis that evaluate the performance of routing in 5G (centralized) and 6G (decentralized) network environments using Machine Learning algorithms.

# Run scripts

Assuming that Mininet Wi-Fi is installed, to run the script execute:

    sudo python <script_name.py>
  
OBS: All Mininet Wi-Fi scripts must be executed in sudo mode, as well as installing any pip packet.
